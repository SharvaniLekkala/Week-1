# Week-1
This repository includes the code, dataset information, and resources needed to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for classifying images of plastic waste. The project focuses on supporting waste management by automating the process of identifying and sorting plastic waste into categories like bottles, bags, and wrappers.

Import necessary libraries.
Load Data: Read images and their respective labels.
Preprocess Data: Convert images to RGB format for standardization.
Organize Data: Store image-label pairs in a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
Visualize Data Distribution: Use a pie chart to check the balance of classes
